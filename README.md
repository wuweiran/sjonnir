# Sjonnir

**Sjonnir**, is a collection of Java projects that are formed from concepts and outlined in sketches.
Projects will be added to and break away from Sjonnir when times come.
It is a code repository, used as an incubator for concept projects that may or may not become an independent project in the future.
